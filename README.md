# Swizzler 2

Swizzler was built as a tool to help analyze MDM/EMS iOS applications, it has grown to incorporate other features to assist and ease the job of penetration testers and security researchers in the security analysis of any iOS application.

The [original Swizzler](https://github.com/vtky/Swizzler) was released along side the BlackHat presentation entitled [**Bad for Enterprise: Attacking BYOD Enterprise Mobile Security Solutions**](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#bad-for-enterprise-attacking-byod-enterprise-mobile-security-solutions).

Full Presentation, White Paper and Video Recording can be found at https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#bad-for-enterprise-attacking-byod-enterprise-mobile-security-solutions

## Updates
Swizzler 2 will now be a collection of Frida scripts that will perform similar functions that the original Swizzler provides. Frida is faster (more than 10x) and more flexible as compared to CydiaSubstrate.

A guide will also be provided for testing of iOS applications on non-jailbroken iOS devices. The latest and greatest iOS version (currently 10.1b3) will be used for testing.

Stuff will be slowly organised and released over the next coming weeks.
